# Dynamic Array Input & Sum Calculator

A C program that dynamically allocates memory for an array, allows user input validation, and calculates the sum of elements.

## üìå Features
- Dynamically allocates memory based on user input.
- Handles invalid input and prevents crashes.
- Displays stored values and computes their sum.
- Properly frees allocated memory to prevent leaks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- A C compiler (GCC recommended)
- A Unix-like terminal (Linux/macOS) or MinGW (Windows)

### **Installation & Compilation**
Clone the repository and compile the program using GCC:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
gcc -o run.exe memory_allocater.c
```

### **Usage**
Run the compiled program:

```sh
./run.exe
```

Then, follow the prompts to:
1. Enter the number of elements.
2. Input integer values.
3. See the stored values and their sum.

### **Example**
```
Enter number of elements in array: 3
Adding 3 elements!

Memory allocation successful!
Memory address of the first element: 0x600003db0020

Allocate values to store in memory
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Enter value for element 1: 5
Enter value for element 2: 10
Enter value for element 3: 15

Values stored: 5 10 15
Sum of the values: 30

Memory freed!
```
